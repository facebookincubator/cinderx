"""Package for compiling Python source code

There are several functions defined at the top level that are imported
from modules contained in the package.

compile(source, filename, mode, flags=None, dont_inherit=None)
    Returns a code object.  A replacement for the builtin compile() function.

compileFile(filename)
    Generates a .pyc file by compiling filename.
